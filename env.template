# Backend API Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and update with your actual URLs

# Timesheet Backend API URL
# For local development: http://localhost:3000
# For production: https://api.yourbackend.com
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Auth Service API URL
# For local development: http://localhost:3002
# For production: https://api.yourbackend.com (or separate auth URL)
VITE_AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3002

# Production Example:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourbackend.com
# VITE_AUTH_SERVICE_URL=https://auth.yourbackend.com

# Notes:
# - All Vite environment variables MUST start with VITE_ prefix
# - These are embedded at BUILD time, not runtime
# - Changes require rebuilding the app
# - For AWS Amplify, set these in the Amplify Console under "Environment variables"
